# HackPrinceton 2015

We wrap tcpflow to arrange data for dynamic visualisation.

Our goal is to raise awareness about the quantity of personal information available to everyone connected to a network. We accomplish this using a fun and interactive image board.

There are plently of networking tools out there but what can non-network specialists get out of it?

Nothing. The majority of people don't understand the network traffic. Knowing the OSI model and protocols by heart can be painfull. We belive that our tool will bring more people into networking by making visualization accessible and fun.
